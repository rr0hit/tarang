Tarang
[Object-oriented Pseudo-spectral code for turbulence simulation]

The original software was hosted here [1].  We've started building
upon it after importing the history from Hg.

Requirements
------------
Most significantly, the program depends on MPI [2] and FFTW3 [3]
libraries.  On most distributions, the required packages should be
called something like 'mpich2-dev' and 'libfftw3-dev'.  However, note
that for the purposes of this program, FFTW3 needs to be compiled with
MPI support, and this is not enabled by default.  Whether or not your
distribution's fftw package contains this or not depends on the
distribution.  If it does not, like in Debian's case [4], simply
download and ask the configure script to '--enable-mpi' while
compiling.

Compilation
-----------
Invoke `cmake .` to generate a Makefile.  Then use make to compile the
program.  If everything went well, the final target binary called
'tarangMPI' should appear.

Usage
-----
Execute 'tarangMPI' from within the 'info/' subdirectory.  Configure
in prog_para.d.

Caution
-------
Don't expect this program to behave in a sane/ nice way.  Most of it
is written very badly; even removing comments from the configuration
file will break the program.  Handle with care, and send tons of pull
requests!

Team
----
I'm part of a small research group in the Physics department of IIT
Kharagpur.  We're attempting to extend this program to do something
new and exciting.
