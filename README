Tarang
[Object-oriented Pseudo-spectral code for turbulence simulation]

The original software was hosted here [1].  We've started building
upon it after importing the history from Hg.

Requirements
------------
Most significantly, the program depends on MPI [2] and FFTW3 [3]
libraries.  On most distributions, the required packages should be
called something like 'mpich2-dev' and 'libfftw3-dev'.  However, note
that for the purposes of this program, FFTW3 needs to be compiled with
MPI support, and this is not enabled by default.  Whether or not your
distribution's fftw package contains this or not depends on the
distribution.  If it does not, like in Debian's case [4], simply
download and ask the configure script to '--enable-mpi' while
compiling.

Compilation
-----------
Invoke `cmake .` to generate a Makefile.  Then use make to compile the
program.  If everything went well, the final target binary called
'tarangMPI' should appear.

Usage
-----
Execute 'tarangMPI' from within the 'info/' subdirectory.  Configure
in prog_para.d.

Caution
-------
The program is written very badly, and it is quite fragile as a
result.  To make things worse, there is no working testsuite.  Handle
with care, and send tons of pull requests!

Team
----
I'm part of a small research group in the Physics department of IIT
Kharagpur.  We're attempting to extend this program to do something
new and exciting.
